This is the "policy" product for the public portal of the Early Detection
Research Network (EDRN_).  This product, intended for Plone_, specifies no
custom content types or look-and-feel, but instead specifies minimum policy
settings and orchestrates all other dependent components.  So, to turn a
Plone_ site into the EDRN public portal, just install this component.

It was developed by the Informatics Center (IC_), operated by JPL_.
