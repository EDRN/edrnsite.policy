<p><a href="http://www.nih.gov/icd/od/foia/efoia.htm">The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552</a> provides individuals with a 
	right to access information in the possession of the U.S. federal government. 
	The government, however, may withhold information covered by 9 exemptions and 3 
	exclusions contained in the Act.</p>
<p>Before submitting a request under FOIA, individuals should try to determine 
	whether the information sought is already in the public domain and whether it 
	is or may be held by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). NCI has a wealth of 
	information available in both published and electronic formats. A search of 
	the EDRN web Site, edrn.nci.nih.gov, can be helpful in locating information and 
	lists of available publications.</p>
<p>If data produced under an NCI grant are sought, the data will be released under 
	FOIA only if specific requirements are met.</p>
<p>It is important to note that FOIA allows agencies to recover part of the 
	costs associated with responding to requests. 
	<a href="http://www.nih.gov/icd/od/foia/cfr45.htm#cfrfees">Department of Health and Human Services regulations</a> 
	describe specific rules for fees, requesting a fee waiver, 
	and reducing fees.</p>
<p>Questions about FOIA and requests for information held by NCI can be directed 
	either to the 
	<a href="http://legislative.cancer.gov/foia">NCI FOIA Office</a> or to the 
	<a href="http://www.nih.gov/icd/od/foia">National Institutes of Health (NIH) FOIA Office</a>.</p>
