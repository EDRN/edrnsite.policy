    <ns1:blinding>Disease status was blinded for batch 1, but was unblinded after analysis was done to determine if the findings are sufficiently promising to proceed with the rest of the CARET sera</ns1:blinding>
    <ns1:finalSampleSize>100 blood samples from lung cancer patients and 100 matching controls were randomly chosen in pairs from CARET. Each case and control pair was matched on age at enrollment (5-year intervals), sex, intervention arm (active vitamins or placebo), exposure population (asbestos or heavy smoker), baseline smoking status (active or former), year of enrollment, and year of blood draw.</ns1:finalSampleSize>
    <ns1:objective>1.1    To validate the finding from pilot studies with CARET sera of autoantibodies to annexins I and II and PGP9.5 as potential biomarkers for lung cancers before the clinical diagnosis, evaluating sensitivity and specificity by time before diagnosis, treatment arm, gender, histologic type, and smoking status.

1.2   To determine whether a pattern of occurrence of autoantibodies in lung cancer sera may be diagnostic of lung cancer that is not dependent on the occurrence of any particular autoantibody.

1.3   To compare the findings for individual biomarker candidates and combinations of biomarker candidates in participants who were current smokers versus former smokers.
</ns1:objective>
    <ns1:outcome>Annexin was significantly elevated in lung cancer patients in serum 0-12 months prior to diagnosis (p-value = 0.001) and the area under ROC curve 0.71 with 95% confidence interval from 0.63 to 0.78.  The direct clinical utility for Annexin in pre-clinical high risk (heavy smoker) population is unclear as the sensitivity at 90% specificity is 25%, or sensitivity 55% at 80% specificity.  However, this validated marker could serve as a member in a panel, yet to be formed, to reach clinical utility for early detection of lung cancer.

Lung cancer reference set A specified a PPV of 2.5% would be clinically significant assuming lung cancer incidence among heavy smokers is 1% per year. If we apply 25% sensitivity at 90% specificity in this study, PPV is 2.5%. Note that CARET specimens used in this study were collected within 12 month prior to diagnosis, not at diagnosis. This indicates potential use of Annexin to enrich the high risk smokers for further screening (e.g. CT), though the enrichment is a moderate 2.5 folds. Given Hanash Lab using specimens at diagnosis observed 40-50% sensitivity with near 100% specificity, it seems that the diagnostic performance of Annexin improves as time near diagnosis. Therefore, it is recommended that Annexin should also be validated for itâ€™s potential clinical use for aiding diagnosis among patients having suspicious lesions in lung (lung cancer reference set B).

PGP was not significantly associated with lung cancer in pre-clinical serum.

Our findings suggest potential utility of an approach to diagnosis of lung cancer before onset of symptoms that includes screening for autoantibodies to defined antigens
