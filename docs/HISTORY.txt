1.0.2 - Specimen Search
-----------------------

This time around, the policy package implements a dynamic search page for EDRN
specimens.  (There is no corresponding issue in the issue tracker for this new
feature; or if there is, the issue tracker is down as I write this and can't
confirm.)

The following issues are also addressed by this release:

* CA-684 - Breadcrumb links are not correct on specimen search tab
* CA-667 - Organ and title edits that were added were lost when re-ingesting


1.0.1 - Ingest Cleanup
----------------------

This release addresses the following:

* CA-649 - Automatic ingest is not updating publication state
* CA-662 - Remove "Potential Link Breakage" message from automatic ingest

It also adds a dynamic list of EDRN members and allows YouTube videos to be
embedded in portal pages.  See the issue tracker at
https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA for more details.


1.0.0 - Automation Spam
-----------------------

This release addresses several issues: the automatic periodic ingest of RDF
information into the portal from its various information sources.  You can
read more about this issue at https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA-528.

It also adds search and tracking of tissue and other specimens from ERNE, the
EDRN Resource Network Exchange.

Finally, it reworks the logic by which the emailed portal notices are sent.
Previously, any content addition, deletion, modification, or any content
publication state change would trigger an email to the DMCC.  These included
all changes during RDF ingest, which could amount to thousands of such
changes.

Now, the email notice is sent solely if the user who's doing the change is a
member of the "National Cancer Institute" group.  For more details on this
update, see https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA-644.
